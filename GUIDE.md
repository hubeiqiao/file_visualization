## Getting Started

### Setting Up Your API Key

1. Obtain an Anthropic API key with access to Claude 3.7 Sonnet from [Anthropic's website](https://console.anthropic.com/).
2. Enter your API key in the designated field and click "Validate Key".
3. If valid, the key will be stored in your browser's local storage for convenience.

### Uploading Content

You can provide content in two ways:

#### File Upload
- Click on the upload area or drag and drop a file.
- Supported file types include txt, md, json, csv, html, js, css, py, and other text-based formats.
- The file content will be read and processed automatically.

#### Text Input
- Switch to the "Enter Text" tab.
- Type or paste your content directly into the text area.

### Additional Instructions

The "Additional Instructions" field allows you to provide specific guidance to Claude on how to visualize your content. For example:

- "Format this as a modern documentation page with a table of contents."
- "Visualize this data as an interactive dashboard with explanatory text."
- "Transform this technical content into an accessible tutorial for beginners."

### Generating the Visualization

1. Click the "Generate Visualization" button to start the process.
2. You'll see the HTML being generated in real-time.
3. When complete, you can:
   - Preview the HTML directly in the embedded viewer
   - Open the preview in a new tab
   - Copy the HTML to clipboard
   - Download the HTML file

## Understanding Claude 3.7 Parameters

### Temperature (0-1)

The temperature parameter controls the randomness of Claude's output:

- **Lower values (0.0-0.3)**: More deterministic, focused outputs. Best for precise, factual visualizations.
- **Medium values (0.4-0.7)**: Balanced creativity and coherence. Good for most visualization tasks.
- **Higher values (0.8-1.0)**: More creative, diverse outputs. Useful for exploratory or artistic visualizations.

### Max Tokens (1K-128K)

This parameter limits the length of Claude's response:

- For simple documents or small data sets: 16,000-32,000 tokens is typically sufficient.
- For complex or lengthy content: 64,000-128,000 tokens may be necessary.
- If your visualization appears incomplete, try increasing this value.

### Thinking Budget (1K-128K)

The thinking budget determines how much computational effort Claude can spend reasoning about your content:

- **Lower values (1K-8K)**: Faster processing, but less thorough analysis.
- **Medium values (8K-32K)**: Good balance of speed and quality for most content.
- **Higher values (32K-128K)**: More comprehensive analysis, particularly beneficial for complex or technical content.

## Tips for Effective File Visualization

### Optimal File Types

Claude 3.7 performs best with structured content that has clear organization. Consider these formats:

- **Markdown (.md)**: Excellent for documentation, articles, and structured text.
- **JSON/CSV**: Great for data visualization and tabular information.
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Good for refactoring or enhancing existing web content.
- **Programming code**: Works well for code documentation and explanation.

### Effective Additional Prompts

Your additional instructions can significantly impact the quality of visualization. Consider:

1. **Specify the audience**: "Create this for technical professionals" or "Make this accessible to beginners."
2. **Indicate purpose**: "This should be a reference guide" or "Make this an engaging tutorial."
3. **Suggest visual elements**: "Include diagrams for key concepts" or "Organize data in tables and charts."
4. **Define style**: "Use a minimalist design with a focus on readability" or "Create a visually rich presentation."

### Batch Processing Recommendations

For very large files (20K+ tokens):

1. Split the content into logical sections before uploading.
2. Process each section with consistent style instructions.
3. For code repositories, focus on one module or component at a time.

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues

- Ensure your API key has access to Claude 3.7 Sonnet
- Check that your API key hasn't expired or reached its quota
- Try regenerating your API key from the Anthropic console

### Generation Errors

- **Timeouts**: For large inputs, try reducing the thinking budget to speed up processing.
- **Incomplete results**: Increase the max tokens parameter.
- **Formatting issues**: Ensure your input file is properly formatted and uses UTF-8 encoding.

### Visualization Quality Issues

- If the visualization is too simple or lacks structure, try increasing the thinking budget.
- If the style isn't what you expected, be more specific in your additional instructions.
- For complex data or code, try providing context about the content in your additional instructions.

## Advanced Usage

### Customizing the System Prompt

The default system prompt is designed for general-purpose visualization, but you can request specific visualization styles:

- **Documentation site**: Ask for a documentation-style layout with navigation and search.
- **Dashboard**: Request data to be presented in chart and graph format with explanations.
- **Tutorial**: Ask for step-by-step instructions with code samples and explanations.
- **Report**: Request executive summary, findings, and detailed analysis sections.

### Working with Code Repositories

When visualizing code:

1. Include relevant README and documentation files to provide context.
2. Focus on one component or module at a time rather than entire codebases.
3. Ask Claude to create an architectural overview with explanations of key components.

### Cost Optimization

To minimize token usage and costs:

1. Pre-process large files to remove unnecessary content.
2. Start with a lower thinking budget and increase only if needed.
3. For similar documents, reuse successful prompts rather than experimenting.
4. Monitor the usage statistics to understand your typical token consumption.
